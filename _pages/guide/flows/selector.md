title: Flow Selector
permalink: /guide/flows/selector
---

There's only a limited number of nodes you can put in a flow before the editor gets cramped and/or the flow gets too complicted.
Larger systems and complicated flows can usually be broken down into multiple flows.

Exred supports multiple flows and groups them into services.

__Note__ currently there's no support for subflows and connections between flows. Both of these will be implemeted in the future. There's also no way to add new services yet.

__Adding Flows__  
Open the flow selector (click on the arrow in the top left corner of the navigation bar). This will open the flow selector sidebar.  
To add a new flow either click on the big plus button or select Add Flow from the Service's menu.

__Deleting Flows__  
Select Delete in the flow's menu.  

__Note:__ there's no confirmation dialog however you need to delete all nodes and connections first before you can delete the flows (this will most likely change in a future release)
